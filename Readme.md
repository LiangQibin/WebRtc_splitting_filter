# The performance of Splitting filter

Below is the performance of the WebRtc's three-band splitting filter and the two-band splitting filter. We can find that there are two -30dB notches located at around 8khz and 16khz  in the frequency response of three-band filter. Be careful for that cases when using in your production. 

When running in PC with a 1.8 Ghz cpu, it costs about 1.4077 ms per analysis and synthesis operations,2.53 MIPS in the test. Meanwhile, apply the same test to the two-band QMF filter,it only costs 0.1865ms per analysis and synthesis operations,  0.355 MIPS. As it has been optimized with fix-point processing in the implement.

More details and usages please find the code in the Visual studio project. These two splitting filter implements are captured from WebRtc and rewrote with C .

-----
Measured with 0~20kHz swept-sine signal, the sample rate is 48kHz for the three-band splitting filter and 32khz for the two-band filter.
